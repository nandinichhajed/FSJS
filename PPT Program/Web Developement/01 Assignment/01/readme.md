<!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?

Yes, `<!DOCTYPE html>` is indeed a tag used in HTML. However, it is not a regular HTML tag like `<div>` or `<p>`. Instead, it is called a Document Type Declaration (DTD).

The purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is to specify the version of HTML that the web page is using. In this case, the declaration indicates that the page is using HTML5, the latest version of the HTML standard.

The reason for including the doctype declaration is to ensure that web browsers interpret the HTML markup correctly. Different versions of HTML have different rules and features, so specifying the correct doctype helps the browser understand how to parse and render the web page.

Without the doctype declaration, web browsers may enter a "quirks mode" or "compatibility mode" where they try to accommodate older or non-standard HTML code. This can lead to inconsistent rendering across different browsers and versions.

Including `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the beginning of an HTML document is considered best practice for modern web development, as it ensures that browsers interpret the page in the most up-to-date and standardized manner.
