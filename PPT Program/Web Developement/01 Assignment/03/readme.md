Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

In HTML, there is a distinction between tags and elements.

**HTML Tags:** Tags are the markup syntax used to define the structure and appearance of content within an HTML document. They are represented by angled brackets (< and >) and are used to enclose elements. For example, `<p>`, `<div>`, and `<img>` are all examples of HTML tags.

**HTML Elements:** Elements, on the other hand, are made up of tags along with the content they enclose. An HTML element consists of an opening tag, the content or nested elements, and a closing tag. For example, consider the `<p>` tag:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

In this example, `<p>` is the opening tag, `This is a paragraph.` is the content, and `</p>` is the closing tag. Together, they form the `<p>` element.

Elements can also be self-closing, meaning they do not have any content or nested elements. In such cases, the closing tag is omitted, and a slash (/) is placed before the closing angle bracket. For example:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />
```

In this case, `<img>` is a self-closing element, commonly used for inserting images, and it doesn't require a closing tag.

To summarize:

- **HTML Tags** are the markup syntax enclosed in angled brackets (< and >), used to define the structure and appearance of content.
- **HTML Elements** are comprised of tags, along with the content or nested elements they enclose. Elements consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (except for self-closing elements).

HTML tags define the types of elements that can be used in an HTML document, while elements represent the actual instances of those tags used to structure and present the content.
