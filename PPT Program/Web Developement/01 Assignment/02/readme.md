Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

Semantic tags in HTML are elements that provide meaning and structure to the content within a web page. Unlike generic tags like <div> or <span>, semantic tags convey the purpose or role of the content they wrap. They describe the significance of the enclosed content, making it more meaningful and accessible.

Here are some commonly used semantic tags in HTML5:

<header>: Represents the introductory section of a page or a section within it, typically containing a logo, navigation, and introductory content.
<nav>: Defines a section of navigation links.
<main>: Represents the main content of a document. There should be only one <main> element per page.
<article>: Encloses self-contained content, such as blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.
<section>: Defines a thematic grouping of content within a document, such as chapters, tabs, or different parts of a page.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars or call-out boxes.
<footer>: Represents the footer section of a document or a section within it, typically containing authorship information, copyright details, and related links.
Using semantic tags brings several benefits:

Improved Accessibility: Semantic tags help screen readers and assistive technologies understand the structure and meaning of the content, making it more accessible to users with disabilities.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines can better understand the purpose and hierarchy of content within semantic tags, potentially improving the page's visibility in search results.
Maintainability and Readability: Semantic tags make the HTML code more readable and understandable for developers, facilitating maintenance and collaboration.
Consistent Styling: Semantic tags often come with default styling, making it easier to apply consistent styles across different web pages that use the same semantic structure.
Future Compatibility: Semantic tags are designed to be forward-compatible, meaning they are less likely to become outdated as new versions of HTML are introduced.
By adopting semantic tags, web developers can create more structured, accessible, and maintainable web pages while improving search engine optimization and future compatibility.
