# Q.4 What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6?

ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, introduced several significant features and improvements to the JavaScript language. Here are some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6:

1. Block-Scoped Variables: The introduction of `let` and `const` keywords allows the declaration of block-scoped variables, providing better control over variable scope and reducing issues related to hoisting and accidental redeclaration.

2. Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have a more compact syntax, lexical scoping of `this`, and implicit return when no curly braces `{}` are used.

3. Classes: ES6 introduced class syntax, allowing developers to define classes and work with object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, constructors, and static methods in a more familiar and structured manner.

4. Modules: ES6 introduced native support for modules, enabling modular development by allowing files to export and import functionality using the `export` and `import` keywords. This promotes better code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

5. Template Literals: Template literals provide a convenient syntax for creating multiline strings and embedding expressions within them using backticks (` `). They support string interpolation and offer more expressive and readable string manipulation.

6. Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into individual variables, providing a concise way to unpack and assign values. It simplifies the process of working with complex data structures.

7. Default Parameters: ES6 introduced the ability to define default values for function parameters, eliminating the need for manual checks and enabling more flexible function invocation.

8. Rest and Spread Operators: The rest (`...`) and spread (`...`) operators allow you to work with variable-length argument lists and arrays. The rest operator collects multiple arguments into an array, while the spread operator expands an array or iterable into individual elements.

9. Enhanced Object Literals: ES6 introduced enhancements to object literals, allowing the creation of objects with concise syntax, computed property names, method shorthand, and easy definition of getters and setters.

10. Promises: Promises provide a built-in mechanism for handling asynchronous operations. They simplify working with asynchronous code, making it easier to write and reason about asynchronous workflows.

These are just some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6. ES6 brought significant enhancements and modernizations to JavaScript, leading to improved code quality, better developer productivity, and increased language capabilities.
