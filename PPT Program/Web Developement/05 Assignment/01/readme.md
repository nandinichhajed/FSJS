# Q.1 What’s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?

Synchronous and asynchronous are two different programming paradigms that describe the behavior and flow of execution in a program.

Synchronous:
- Synchronous execution refers to a sequential and blocking approach where each operation or task must complete before the program proceeds to the next one.
- In synchronous programming, tasks are executed one after another in a predefined order, and the program waits for each task to finish before moving on.
- Synchronous operations can block the execution of other code until they are completed.
- Synchronous code is straightforward to read and reason about as the flow of execution is predictable.

Example of synchronous code:
```javascript
console.log('First');
console.log('Second');
console.log('Third');
```
In this example, the statements are executed one after the other, and each `console.log` must finish before the next one is executed.

Asynchronous:
- Asynchronous execution, on the other hand, allows multiple tasks or operations to be initiated without waiting for each other to complete.
- In asynchronous programming, tasks are executed independently and do not block the execution of other code.
- Asynchronous operations typically involve callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax to handle the results or completion of tasks.
- Asynchronous code is useful for tasks that may take time to complete, such as network requests or file operations, allowing other parts of the program to continue running in the meantime.

Example of asynchronous code using a callback:
```javascript
console.log('First');
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Second');
}, 2000);
console.log('Third');
```
In this example, the `setTimeout` function schedules the execution of the callback function after a delay of 2000 milliseconds. The program continues to execute the next statement (`console.log('Third')`) without waiting for the delay to complete.

Asynchronous code allows for more efficient utilization of resources and better responsiveness, especially in scenarios involving I/O operations, network requests, or interactions with user interfaces. It enables non-blocking behavior and better handling of long-running tasks.

It's important to note that working with asynchronous code requires proper handling of callbacks, promises, or async/await patterns to ensure correct sequencing and error handling.
