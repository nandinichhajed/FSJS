# Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await?

To define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using `async/await`, you can prefix the function declaration with the `async` keyword. This indicates that the function will operate asynchronously and will always return a promise.

Here's an example of defining an asynchronous function using `async/await`:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  // Asynchronous operations
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function is declared with the `async` keyword, indicating that it is an asynchronous function. Inside the function, asynchronous operations are performed using `await`. The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until the promise is resolved or rejected. The function will then resume when the awaited promise is fulfilled, and the resolved value will be assigned to the respective variable.

The `fetchData` function above uses the `fetch()` function to make an HTTP request and retrieve JSON data. It awaits the response and then uses `response.json()` to parse the response body as JSON. Finally, it returns the data.

To call an asynchronous function, you can use the `await` keyword before the function call, which allows you to wait for the promise to resolve before proceeding with the execution:

```javascript
async function processAsyncData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

processAsyncData();
```

In this example, the `processAsyncData` function is also declared as an asynchronous function. It calls the `fetchData` function using `await`, waits for the promise to resolve, and then logs the data. Any errors that occur within the `fetchData` function are caught in the `try-catch` block.

Using `async/await` simplifies asynchronous code by allowing you to write asynchronous operations in a more synchronous-like manner, making the code more readable and easier to reason about. It eliminates the need for explicit promise chaining and avoids excessive nesting of callbacks.
