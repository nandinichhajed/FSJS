# Q.5 What are Callbacks &  Callback Hell ?

Callbacks in JavaScript refer to functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed at a later time or when a certain condition is met. They are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations, such as making network requests or reading files, where the result is not immediately available.

Here's an example of a callback function:

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = 'Async data';
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
}

function handleData(data) {
  console.log(data);
}

fetchData(handleData);
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function takes a callback function as an argument and simulates an asynchronous operation by using `setTimeout`. Once the operation is complete, the callback function (`handleData`) is invoked with the retrieved data as an argument.

Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, refers to a situation where multiple asynchronous operations are nested within each other using callbacks, resulting in deeply indented and hard-to-read code. It occurs when callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations that depend on each other or have complex dependencies.

Here's an example of callback hell:

```javascript
asyncFunction1((error, result1) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    asyncFunction2(result1, (error, result2) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(error);
      } else {
        asyncFunction3(result2, (error, result3) => {
          if (error) {
            console.error(error);
          } else {
            // ... more nested callbacks
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
});
```

As you can see, each asynchronous operation depends on the completion of the previous one, leading to nested callbacks that quickly become hard to read and maintain. The indentation grows deeper with each level, making the code harder to follow and prone to errors.

Callback hell can make code harder to debug, understand, and modify. It can lead to poor code quality, maintainability issues, and difficulties in error handling. To mitigate callback hell, modern JavaScript introduced promises, async/await, and other patterns that provide more structured and readable ways to handle asynchronous code.
