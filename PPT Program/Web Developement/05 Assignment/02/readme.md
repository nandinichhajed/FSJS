# Q.2 What are Web Apis ?

Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols provided by web browsers to enable developers to interact with web browser functionality and access various features and services. Web APIs provide a way for web applications to access and manipulate web content, perform network requests, control browser behavior, and more.

Web APIs can be categorized into different types based on their functionality:

1. Document Object Model (DOM) APIs:
   - DOM APIs allow developers to manipulate and interact with the HTML structure and content of web pages. They provide methods and properties to access, modify, and create HTML elements, handle events, and dynamically update the page.

2. XMLHttpRequest and Fetch APIs:
   - These APIs provide functionality for making HTTP requests from the browser. They allow developers to retrieve data from remote servers, send data, and handle the server's response asynchronously.

3. Geolocation API:
   - The Geolocation API provides access to the device's geographical location information, such as latitude and longitude. It allows web applications to request and track the user's location, enabling location-based services.

4. Canvas and WebGL APIs:
   - These APIs enable the creation and manipulation of 2D and 3D graphics and animations within the browser. The Canvas API provides a drawing surface for rendering graphics, while the WebGL API provides a lower-level, hardware-accelerated interface for rendering 3D graphics.

5. Web Storage API:
   - The Web Storage API provides a way to store key-value pairs locally in the browser. It offers two mechanisms: `localStorage` for persistent storage and `sessionStorage` for temporary storage. These APIs allow web applications to store data on the client-side, persist data across sessions, and share data within a single domain.

6. Web Audio API:
   - The Web Audio API allows developers to create, manipulate, and play audio within web applications. It provides advanced audio processing features, including audio synthesis, effects, and precise timing control.

7. WebRTC API:
   - The WebRTC (Real-Time Communication) API enables real-time communication between web browsers or applications. It provides protocols and functionality for peer-to-peer audio, video, and data streaming without the need for additional plugins or software.

These are just a few examples of the many web APIs available to developers. Web APIs empower web developers to extend the capabilities of web applications and leverage browser functionality to create rich, interactive, and powerful web experiences.
