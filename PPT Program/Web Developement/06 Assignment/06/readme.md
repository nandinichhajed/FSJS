# Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?

Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass or interface. It enables the use of a single interface to represent multiple related classes, providing flexibility and extensibility in code design.

The purpose of polymorphism is to provide a way to write more flexible and reusable code by allowing objects to take on multiple forms and exhibit different behaviors based on their context.

Here's how polymorphism works and its purpose:

1. Method Overriding:
   - Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass or interface.
   - The overridden method in the subclass can have a different behavior but the same signature (method name and parameters) as the method in the superclass.
   - This allows objects of the subclass to be used interchangeably with objects of the superclass, and the appropriate implementation of the method is determined dynamically at runtime.

2. Dynamic Binding:
   - Polymorphism utilizes dynamic binding, where the specific implementation of a method is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object being referred to, rather than the type of the reference.
   - This allows for flexibility in method invocation, as the correct method implementation is resolved dynamically based on the actual object's type.

3. Code Flexibility and Extensibility:
   - Polymorphism allows for code flexibility and extensibility by providing a common interface that can be implemented by multiple classes.
   - It enables the substitution of objects of different types, as long as they adhere to the common interface or superclass.
   - With polymorphism, you can write code that can work with objects of different types without needing to know their specific implementations.

4. Code Reusability:
   - Polymorphism promotes code reusability by allowing a single method or interface to be reused by multiple classes.
   - By defining a common interface or superclass, you can write code that is more generic and can handle a wider range of objects without the need for specific implementation details.

Polymorphism helps in creating modular, flexible, and maintainable code. It enables the writing of more generic and adaptable algorithms that can operate on a variety of objects, providing a higher level of abstraction. Polymorphism is a powerful tool for achieving code reuse, promoting code modularity, and supporting the concept of polymorphic behavior in object-oriented programming.
