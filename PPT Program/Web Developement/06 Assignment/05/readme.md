# Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that focuses on representing the essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows you to create simplified and generalized models of complex systems by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.

The purpose of abstraction is to provide a way to manage complexity, increase code maintainability, and improve code readability. It helps in creating more understandable and manageable code structures by breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable units.

Here's how abstraction is achieved and its purpose:

1. Abstraction through Classes and Interfaces:
   - Abstraction is achieved through the use of classes and interfaces.
   - Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, abstracting away the implementation details.
   - Interfaces define a contract for a group of classes, specifying the required methods without providing the implementation details.
   - By creating classes and interfaces, you can define a higher level of abstraction that represents common properties and behaviors.

2. Hiding Internal Details:
   - Abstraction allows you to hide the internal complexities of an object or system and expose only the necessary and relevant information to the outside world.
   - It provides a clear separation between the public interface and the implementation details.
   - Encapsulation, which is a key concept in OOPS, helps achieve abstraction by hiding the internal state and implementation of an object.

3. Simplifying Usage:
   - Abstraction simplifies the usage of complex systems or objects by providing a clear and concise interface.
   - It enables you to work with objects at a higher level of understanding, focusing on their essential features and functionalities rather than the low-level implementation details.
   - Users of an abstracted object or system can interact with it through a well-defined interface, without needing to know the underlying complexities.

4. Code Reusability:
   - Abstraction promotes code reusability by providing a generic interface or base class that can be inherited or implemented by multiple derived classes.
   - Abstracting common behaviors and properties into a superclass or interface allows for code reuse across different implementations.

By applying abstraction, you can build modular, maintainable, and scalable code. It enables you to create generalized models that can be easily extended and adapted to accommodate changes in requirements. Abstraction helps in reducing code duplication, improving code organization, and making it easier to understand and modify.
