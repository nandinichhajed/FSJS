# Question 2

Given a Binary Search Tree with all unique values and two keys. Find the distance between two nodes in BST. The given keys always exist in BST.

**Input-1:**

n = 9

values = [8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14,13]

node-1 = 6

node-2 = 14

**Output-1:**

The distance between the two keys = 4

**Input-2:**

n = 9

values = [8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14,13]

node-1 = 3

node-2 = 4

**Output-2:**

The distance between the two keys = 2
