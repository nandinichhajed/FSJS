# Question 1

Given preorder of a binary tree, calculate its **[depth(or height)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-find-the-maximum-depth-or-height-of-a-tree/)** [starting from depth 0]. The preorder is given as a string with two possible characters.

1. ‘l’ denotes the leaf
2. ‘n’ denotes internal node

The given tree can be seen as a full binary tree where every node has 0 or two children. The two children of a node can ‘n’ or ‘l’ or mix of both.
